Asuka sets the bar pretty high but if you think you can compete with her please message me :)"},{"pasta":"You see this fictional character?

I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle's hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!"},{"pasta":"hello im a cute person with a manga avatar, i have nine friends on steam and i link my equally as degenerate significant other on my profile with a unicode heart\nmy name is minimalistic and ominous, if you insult me, i'll dox you and then bask in my silent glory\ni am a neet with no ambitions, my parents hate me, i dropped out of high school, and im a self proclaimed genius, but i never express it\nmy favorite five groups are \"/d/ is for dickgirls\", \"sad sleepy anime\", \"sleep forever\", \"thigh high lolis\" and a group where the only members are me and my significant other, set to invite only \nmy steam backgrounds are dark and grey, and only 12 cents and maybe even 12 dollars if people try to copy me\nmy significant other is monotoned, girly sounding, anorexic, and shy, we sleep skype together and go on skype dates, i love them so much as i hug my parent's ipad tightly, drifting away at 2 am"},{"pasta":"bitch the fuck are you doing, spaghetti is definitely not European Ramen, the basic idea of Pasta in the first place came from China, which is in Asia hence spaghetti is also just asian, you actual bitches think you can make fun of a country’s delicacy like that? I think the fuck not. Spaghetti is usually served with mince meat and tomato sauce, while ramen on the other hand has a variety of different things to choose from, from its rich aroma and its hand crafted noodles, you white faggots can stay with your machine made hard toothpicks while I slurp and chow down on my exquisite noodles"}]}
